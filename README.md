## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
This challenge seems to be more difficult than the others I did. One of the most things I learnt from it is that fixing the img when I want to cover full screen but still in that div. Additionally, I flexibly use padding, margin to resize or align item, however I would still practice more.

### Continued development
I would continue more challenges which can be focus only html or css, or a little bit javascript. But I do love more all challenge from fronted mentor.
